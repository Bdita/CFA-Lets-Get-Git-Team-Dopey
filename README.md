# Let's Get Git Hackathon

## Team Dopey

## Description

Our application Dopey attempts to solve the problem of
"Hard to accommodate both students who are struggling and excelling in a classroom setting"

We reframed this problem statement slightly by saying
"Hard to accommodate both students who are *needing assistance* and excelling in a *bootcamp* setting"

### Why?

The reason we decided to work on this problem is because "We want to create the best possible experience in becoming a better developer."

And so, with our problem statement, we further identified 3 key issues that seemed to be the reason as to why there were difficulties in accomodating both groups of students.

1. Students can’t keep track of their progress

2. Students find it difficult to ask questions and get them answered

3. Students don’t practice what they have learnt with each other

## Installation instructions

Dopey is written in Ruby and must have it installed (Ruby 2.4 or higher).

1. Clone the repo.

2. Dopey uses ```bundler``` to install dependencies.
```
$ gem install bundler
$ bundler install
$ rails db:create
$ rails db:migrate
$ rails s
```
The ```bundler install``` command must be called in the root directory of the repo.

## Usage installation

To see the Rails application, open up your Chrome/Safari browser and type in: ```http://localhost:3000/```

## Design Journey/Process

The challenge of designing a solution for this problem excited us all! We took the context of the problem to be our classroom - a bootcamp setting but envisioned for this to have the ability to scale to other bootcamp and classroom settings, and hence a very valuable problem to be working on.

We started of by coming up with a solution if there was no technology used. So if we only had pen and paper, what would the solution look like?

And this is what we came up with this low fidelity wire-frame!

Somewhere where I can see the weekly curriculum so both students who needed assistance or were excelling could keep track of their progress.

Somewhere where I could ask questions based on the topics covered as part of the curriculum.

Somewhere to show that I can help other students because I want to improve my teaching/mentoring skills!

So we then added to that by talking about some user stories as a team, and worked on this on Trello and separated it based on the well-known Donut/Sprinkle formula.

And so we worked up from there and decided to put that working solution (without tech) with some key user stories on some sort of tech based interface.

Finally, we worked our way to this medium fidelity which we decided to use to construct our website. But before we decided to code anything, we decided to go through our Entity Relationship Diagram in detail to ensure that we knew how each model was connected to each other!

We were now ready to code! To ensure that we knew exactly what everyone was working on and how their progress was going - we managed to keep track via Trello and essentially had a Kanban style approach and moved cards along as they progressed.
